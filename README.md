# BareboneStorage
A very CHEAP and simple ME style storage program written for ComputerCraft. 

This program is the bare minimum to be classified as a refined storage style program. This is not ready for public use, if you found this by searching I really recommend not using it yet.

Reason why:
There is no way to seperate the networks from each storage server meaning the moment you try to make more than one it'll all be one. This is a simple fix but i'm focusing on features first.

Features (atleast todo):
-Expandable storage using cables and modems hooked up to chests, auto detecting connected chests to the modem
-Portable storage (ender pocket computer) interface using enderchests
-Modded chest support with very easy to add additional mod chests (big name ones like sophisticated, iron chests already added by default)
-Item sorting and routing (Specifically key for super smelting for cheap!)

Is this better than something like refined storage or AE2? LOL NO...
Is this easier to use than something like refined storage or AE2? Eh I'll have chatgpt write up a user guide... a little extra effort.
Is this cheaper than something like refined storage or AE2? YES! EXTREMELY CHEAPER!
